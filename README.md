A basic template repository showcasing R Markdown using GitHub Actions (minimally adapted from this [example](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart)) and a simple GitHub Pages website at https://rmgpanw.github.io/rmarkdown-basics/. 

To activate GitHub Pages, go to repository 'Settings' on github.com, select the 'Pages' tab, then under 'Branch' select `main` and either `/ (root)` or `/docs` folder (the latter option relies on GitHub Actions to copy `index.html` and any other selected website files to a `docs` directory, also creating a new file `GithubActionsOnly.md`).
